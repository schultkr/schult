This technical practical training was conducted as part of the GIZ project "Climate-Resilient Economic Development in Vietnam". The workshop taught advanced methods for integrating climate risks into Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DGE) models. 

Key focus areas included:
* **Shock Modeling:** Practical implementation of storm events, land loss, and labor productivity losses.
* **Technical Calibration:** Use of MATLAB-based tools for the automated preparation of sectoral data for the agriculture, industry, and services sectors.
* **Regional Focus:** Application of modeling scenarios specifically for the Vietnam region to support evidence-based adaptation policy.
